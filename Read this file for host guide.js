//I see, you want to host the `discord.py` bot without integrating it with a Flask web application. Here's a brief guide on how you can host your `discord.py` bot using a cloud hosting service like Heroku:

//1. **Prepare Your Code:**
   //- Make sure your `bot.py` code is ready and includes all the commands and functionality you want for your economy bot.
   //- Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the required packages for your bot.

//2. **Create a `Procfile` File:**
   //- Create a file named `Procfile` (without any file extension) in your project directory.
  // - Inside the `Procfile`, add the following line to specify how to run your `discord.py` bot:
   //  ```
   //  worker: python bot.py
  //   ```
 //  - Make sure `bot.py` matches the name of your main Python script.

//3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
  // - In your Heroku account, create a new app.
 //  - Go to the "Settings" tab and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
//   - Add a new key-value pair for your bot token:
//     - Key: `DISCORD_TOKEN`
 //    - Value: Your actual bot token

//4. **Deploy to Heroku:**
//   - Connect your Heroku app to your GitHub repository or deploy using Heroku CLI.
//   - Once the deployment is complete, Heroku will start running your bot.

//5. **Running the Bot:**
//   - In your `bot.py` code, access your bot token using `os.environ.get('DISCORD_TOKEN')`.
//   - Replace any references to your bot token with `os.environ.get('DISCORD_TOKEN')`.
//
//Now your `discord.py` bot will be hosted on Heroku. It will run as a worker dyno, continuously active and responding to events on your Discord server.
//
//Remember to configure your bot permissions properly, handle error cases, and set up any necessary databases or storage solutions depending on your bot's functionality.

//Keep in mind that this guide provides a basic setup for hosting your bot on Heroku. Depending on your bot's complexity and requirements, you may need to make additional configurations and optimizations.
